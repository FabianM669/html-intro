				This has been pretty fun.  It's only been 3 days, but I'm starting to understand things that I didn't on my own.  Learning about the terminal was cool, didn't know you could do all that, seems useful.  I dreamed in terminal commands last night, kind of creepy, but funny.  Looking forward to making some badass looking websites of my own.
